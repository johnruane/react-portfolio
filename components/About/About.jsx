      I am a frontend developer working at N Brown Group in Manchester and have 10+ years designing and building user interfaces for the web, specifically for ecommerce. Web accessibility and performance are at the forefront of every project I work on - delivering an amazing experience to all customer across all devices.

Most recently I have moved away from UI design into a more full stack development role - CI/CD, integration testing & docker. I have been developing frontends with React and a number of other technologies such as Node, Redux, Typescript, Jest & REST APIs.

Through the purpose of what and who our ecommerce websites are for I have built up strong skills in web accessibility and performance.

I have a BSc honors degree in Computing from Manchester Metropolitan University.
